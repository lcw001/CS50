Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations there was no clear favorite. Teams % chance of winning centered around 20%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000. Germany was the consistent favorite.
